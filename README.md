Just for journal club! i made this via chatGPT but with many iterations since I wanted to test how good the AI in making with a simple prompting :D
<br>
<br>
IMO, it's better to design it first and let the AI build the skeleton. 
<br>
<br>
Then, start implement your idea with the guidance for AI. You will code faster! 
<br>
<br>
Tips? Don't just copy paste the code. Comprehend what it takes and then implement.
<br>
<br>
Saving lots of time!

## Wanna try?
Just clone this and open this in your IDE, type "run streamlit main_app.py" and new window will be opened with the ready to use app!
