# image_resizer (updated)
Just for journal club! 

I made this via chatGPT but with many iterations since I wanted to test how good the AI in making with a simple prompting :D

IMO, it's better to design it first and let the AI build the skeleton. 

Then, start implement your idea with the guidance for AI. You will code faster! 

Tips? Don't just copy paste the code. Comprehend what they are and then start implementing them.

Saving lots of time!


  
## Wanna try?
Follow this steps:
1. Clone this or copy the code (in main_app.py)
2. Install the libraries (if you don't have one)
3. Just run it by typing streamlit run main_app.py
4. New window will be opened with the ready to use app!


## The updates:
- I tested tkinker library which can be used to generate an interface
- This is also simple and doesn't require browser
- Only need two libraries, tkinker and pillow (PIL)
- So, now we have two options to do image resizing! :)
